Deleting a post allows users to retract content that they no longer wish to be public or that may be inappropriate, outdated, or no longer relevant. It provides users with control over their own content and helps maintain the quality and relevance of the platform's content.


 

10.	Logout : 
The "logout" option, often present in web applications, admin panels, or content management systems, refers to the action of terminating an active user session and securely exiting the system. When a user clicks the "logout" button or link, their session is terminated, their authentication status is revoked, and they lose access to privileged areas or functionalities. This process serves several important purposes. Firstly, it enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to the user's account or sensitive data if they inadvertently leave their device unattended. Secondly, it protects user privacy by clearing session-specific information and preventing potential misuse or exposure of personal data. Additionally, logging out allows the system to properly manage and clean up user sessions, freeing up resources and maintaining overall efficiency. In systems with audit trails or activity logs, logging out provides a clear separation between different user sessions, making it easier to track and attribute actions to specific users. Ultimately, the "logout" option is crucial for administrators, content editors, or any authenticated users to securely exit the system when they have finished their tasks, ensuring that sensitive data or privileged functionalities are not accidentally exposed or misused.
 
 

11.	Super User:This account holds complete control, enabling tasks like administrative operations, system configuration modifications, software installations, and security overrides. It's indispensable for system administration, facilitating critical operations like modifying system files, managing user accounts, and configuring system settings.

Despite its power, the superuser account should be used judiciously, adhering to security protocols and the principle of least privilege to ensure system integrity and security.

 

12.	Logout from super form.php
Logging out from the "super_form.php" PHP form involves ending a user's session, particularly one with administrative privileges. This action signifies the termination of the user's authenticated access to the system. Typically, a logout button or link triggers the logout functionality in the form's user interface. Upon activation, the associated PHP script invalidates the user's session by deleting session data on the server and removing session cookies from the user's browser. By logging out, the user forfeits access to privileged system resources and functionalities. This security measure ensures that users must re-authenticate to regain access, preventing unauthorized entry to sensitive information. Furthermore, logging out may prompt additional actions, such as redirecting the user to a logout confirmation page or the login page, providing feedback on the successful termination of the session. Ultimately, logging out from super_form.php is vital for maintaining system security and integrity by securely ending a user's privileged session and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.

     

13.	when a disabled user tires to enter : individuals with physical, cognitive, sensory, or other impairments that may affect their ability to interact with the environment or access information. When such a user tries to enter, they may encounter barriers or challenges that hinder their ability to fully participate or engage. These barriers could include physical obstacles, lack of accommodations, inaccessible features, or discriminatory attitudes. Addressing the needs of disabled users is essential for promoting inclusivity and ensuring equal access to opportunities and resources. It involves implementing accessibility measures, such as providing alternative formats, assistive technologies, or adaptive strategies, to facilitate their participation and enhance their user experience. By recognizing and accommodating the diverse needs of disabled individuals, organizations can create more inclusive and welcoming environments that promote equal access and participation for all.



 

Security and Non-Functional Requirements

1.	The system must be deployed on HTTPS:
Deploying the system on HTTPS ensures secure communication between the
user's browser and the server by encrypting transmitted data. This prevents 
unauthorized access to sensitive information. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS protocols for 
encryption. Obtaining an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted CA and configuring 
the web server for HTTPS is essential. This enhances data security, protects user 
privacy, and maintains trust in the system's integrity.

 


2.	Passwords must be hashed in the database and no MySQL root account used for the PHP code:
Implementing password hashing in the database involves encrypting passwords using 
cryptographic hash functions before storage, providing an additional layer of security 
by converting plain-text passwords into irreversible hashes. Similarly, avoiding the 
direct use of the MySQL root account in PHP code is essential to limit access and 
prevent potential security breaches, emphasizing the creation of separate MySQL user 
accounts with restricted privileges tailored to the application's specific needs. By adhering
to these practices, system security is enhanced through the protection of user 
credentials and sensitive data, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access, and 
maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the application.

 


3.	All SQL must be in Prepared Statements:
Ensuring that all SQL queries are executed through prepared statements is vital for 
preventing SQL injection attacks, a common security vulnerability where attackers 
manipulate input data to execute unauthorized SQL commands. Prepared statements 
provide a robust defense mechanism by separating SQL logic from user input, allowing 
the database to distinguish between code and data, and thereby mitigating the risk 
of malicious SQL injection attacks. By parameterizing queries and binding user-supplied 
values to placeholders, prepared statements significantly enhance the security of the 
application's database interactions, safeguarding against unauthorized access and data 
breaches.
 

4.	All inputs must be validated in every layer: HTML, PHP, and SQL:
Validating inputs across HTML, PHP, and SQL layers is essential for maintaining data 
integrity and preventing security vulnerabilities. Client-side validation in HTML 
provides immediate feedback to users, while PHP validation enforces business rules 
on the server-side. SQL input validation ensures proper sanitization of user-supplied 
data, guarding against SQL injection attacks. By implementing comprehensive input 
validation, developers enhance security, mitigate data breach risks, and maintain data 
integrity.


 



5.	HTML outputs must be sanitized:
Sanitizing HTML outputs is essential for preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, 
a common security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web 
pages viewed by other users. By removing or encoding potentially dangerous 
HTML tags and attributes from user-generated content before rendering it in HTML 
output, developers can mitigate the risk of XSS attacks and protect users from malicious 
code execution. This practice ensures that web applications remain secure and maintain 
the integrity of their content, safeguarding against unauthorized access to sensitive 
information and maintaining user trust.


6.	Role-based access control for registered users and super users:

Implementing role-based access control (RBAC) for registered users and super users is essential 
for managing access privileges and ensuring security in an application. With RBAC, access 
permissions are assigned to users based on their roles, such as regular users or super users, allowing 
administrators to define granular access levels and restrict access to sensitive features or data. 
Regular users may have limited permissions, such as viewing and editing their own content, while 
super users possess elevated privileges, such as managing user accounts or accessing administrative 
functions. By enforcing RBAC, organizations can effectively control access to resources, mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of their systems.
•	A regular user cannot log in as a superuser:
Preventing regular users from logging in as superusers is essential for maintaining security and access control in an application. By implementing role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms, administrators can restrict access privileges based on user roles, ensuring that regular users do not have the authority to access or perform actions reserved for superusers. This measure helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive features or data, safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of the system.
 

•	A regular user cannot edit/update posts of other users:
Restricting regular users from editing or updating posts created by other users is crucial for maintaining data integrity and user privacy in a collaborative environment. By implementing access control mechanisms that validate the user's identity against the author of the post, administrators can prevent unauthorized modifications to content. This measure ensures that users retain control over their own posts, mitigating the risk of unauthorized alterations and preserving the integrity of the platform's content.

 

7.	Session Authentication and Hijacking Prevention: Session authentication and hijacking prevention are critical security measures implemented to safeguard user sessions and protect against unauthorized access to sensitive data. By utilizing secure session management techniques, such as generating unique session identifiers, encrypting session data, and implementing timeout mechanisms, web applications can authenticate users securely and prevent session hijacking attacks. Additionally, employing HTTPS protocol ensures data encryption during session transmission, further enhancing security. Regular monitoring and auditing of session activity, along with implementing measures like CSRF tokens and secure cookie attributes, are essential for mitigating session-related vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of user sessions. 

8.	CSRF Protection:  CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection is crucial for preventing attackers from executing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users. Implementing measures such as CSRF tokens, which are unique and unpredictable tokens embedded in forms or requests, helps verify the authenticity of requests and mitigate CSRF attacks. Additionally, enforcing the SameSite attribute for cookies and implementing secure anti-CSRF mechanisms in web applications can further enhance protection against this type of exploit. By incorporating robust CSRF protection mechanisms, developers can safeguard user data and maintain the integrity of their applications against CSRF vulnerabilities. 



 
9.	Integrating an open-source front-end CSS template: Integrating an open-source front-end CSS template enhances the visual appeal and user experience of a web application by providing pre-designed styles and layout components. By leveraging a well-established CSS template, developers can expedite the development process and maintain consistency across the application's design elements. This approach not only saves time and effort but also ensures responsiveness and accessibility, as many CSS templates are designed with modern web standards and best practices in mind, ultimately enhancing the overall usability and attractiveness of the application.

 

10.	A team project website:  A team project website serves as a centralized platform for collaboration, communication, and project management among team members working on a shared initiative. Through features such as task tracking, file sharing, discussion forums, and progress updates, the website facilitates seamless coordination and information sharing, fostering teamwork, productivity, and accountability. By providing a centralized hub for project-related activities and resources, the website streamlines workflows, promotes transparency, and enhances the overall efficiency and success of the team's endeavors.
